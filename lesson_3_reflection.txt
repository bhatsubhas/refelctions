When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If more than one person is working on a repository then it is beeter to use remote repository.
It also works as a backup incase of system crash or accidental delete.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used when you don't have permission to make changes to the repository. It is GitHub specific option
to create your own copy for modification without touching the original repository.
Clones are used to make your own copy of the repository on the local machine and push changes to the main repository.
Branches are used to create a new feature or experimental changes without touching the master branch. Changes done on the 
branches can be merged with master using git merge command.
